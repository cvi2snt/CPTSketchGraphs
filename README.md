This is the repository for the **CPTSketchGraphs** dataset, a collection of 50 million *Constraint Preserving Transformations (CPTs)* of CAD sketches. CPTs are derived from CAD sketches of the large-scale [SketchGraphs](https://github.com/PrincetonLIPS/SketchGraphs/tree/master) dataset. We aim for **CPTSketchGraphs** to serve as a valuable resource for advancing research in the CAD sketch domain.

## Constraint Preserving Transformations (CPTs)

Our proposed *Constraint Preserving Transformations (CPTs)*, is a novel augmentation strategy particularly tailored for CAD sketches. CPTs leverage the existing _geometric constraints_ within CAD sketches to generate plausible variations of the original design. 

A random local perturbation, such as the translation of a sketch point, is automatically applied to the CAD sketch. Due to the constraints associated with the manipulated point, this local change cascades across the sketch, modifying the parameterization of all connected primitives. The augmentation process is enabled via integration with the [FreeCAD Python API](https://wiki.freecad.org/FreeCAD_API).
